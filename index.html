            <p>Hi my name is Steven Moxley, I'm a Computer Programming student at George Brown College. I love to ride my BMX but also have a serious obsession with Technology and that has
            what has led me down this path as a computer programming student.</p>

                <h2>Just a blog post</h2>
                <p class="date">January, 30, 2017</p>
                <p class="text"> First post and hopefully not the last one. Trying to get myself back into the coding mindset which seems to be alot harder then you think while in school. I seem to always be working on something that doesn't seem to be as much value as
                    just learning about small things such as how to link stylesheets for CSS. If I don't work on something often I tend to forget it and that is already starting to hinder my coding motivation, so lets change it. Let's talk about it and
                    lets change it and CODE!!!</p>
                    <p> ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think about why you question, simply don‚Äôt stop questioning. Don‚Äôt worry about what you can‚Äôt answer, and don‚Äôt try to explain what you can‚Äôt know. Curiosity is its own reason. Aren‚Äôt you in awe when you contemplate
                    the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure behind reality? And this is the miracle of the human mind ‚Äî to use its constructions, concepts, and formulas as tools to explain what man sees, feels and touches. Try to
                    comprehend a little more each day. Have holy curiosity.‚Äù ‚Äî Albert Einstein</p>

                <p class="text">So it's long school day Friday and i'm hella hurting from riding bikes last night. Can't stop won't stop though!! I have also signed up for a python course to start working on a bit more code because like I have been saying
                    since the start of this whole thing we definatly don't do enough coding and for me to start learning more I have to do more. I'm excited to see what comes from it all üòÅ</p>

                <h2>Just A Quick Thought And Read</h2>
                <p class="date">February, 6, 2017</p>
                <p class="text">So here we go again another week of school... Fingers crossed I'm able to alter my thought process and get a bit more on track for both school and lifing. I have decided to try out a new thing even outside the initial blogging, it is to
                    organize my social media life much more aka to limit myself and take the icons and semi hide them from the initial screens I look at to help keep my mind clear and not be tempted to click in and get lost while just browsing nothingness.
                    <br><br> I also came across a really amazing article on Medium.com

                <p class="text">
                    So today I finally worked on code, actually javascript code and built a small pong style game and I'm really excited and thought I should not only make a quick blog post about it but also show it within the blog post üòù I don't fully have the best grasp
                    of it all quite yet but I feel as long as I keep at it it's nothing but learning so there is know way it will be bad for me.</p>

              So the weather outside in a February in Ontario,Canada is absolutely insane and I have been able to go on road bike rides....? That doesn't even make logical sense to younger
              me but I guess that's what global warming is all about. Anyways I decided to get to the book store and pick up what I believe should be a really good help to my javascript program
              learning.</p>
